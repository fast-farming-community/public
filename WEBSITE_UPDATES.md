<p style="color: #7289da;"><strong>Website Updates 27.02.2022</strong></p>
Tyria Bags
https://fast.farming-community.eu/bags/tyria-bags

- moved Tyrian Exchange Voucher from Currency Conversion Category to Tyria Bag
Farming Guides
https://fast.farming-community.eu/farming/guides/farming-preparation

- updated changes on Magic Find (750% Max with Boosters)

<p style="color: #7289da;"><strong>Website Updates 15.02.2022</strong></p>
An option regarding inclusion or exclusion of Mystic Clovers from farmtrain and reward track profit calculations was added to the cog settings, as the game lacks methods of directly converting clovers to gold.

This was done so users can see the profit a farmtrain or reward track provides them with if they do not intend to spend their profits on legendary crafting. As crafting legendary gear is such a widespread goal however, the option to consider them for calculations remains.
Cog Settings
- added Mystic Clover to be included / excluded from total profit calculations for Farmtrains, Drizzlewood Reward Track and Drizzlewood Material Donation.

<p style="color: #7289da;"><strong>Website Updates 14.02.2022</strong></p>

<p style="color: #7289da;"><strong>Website Updates 08.10.2020</strong></p>
Unid Gear
- fixed a major calculation mistake - adding taxes to Unid Gear: We are comparing Unid Gear, which is sold with taxes on the TP vs Salvaging Materials which are also sold with taxes on the TP

If you are buying Unid Gear off the TP, you have to remove the taxes, which will lower the profit margin! This category is going to be added in the future.
